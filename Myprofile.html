            <td><p> <br><br>A poor orphan from the wrong side of the tracks in the days leading up to World War II, goodhearted Steve Rogers enlisted in the army to fight the Axis Powers, but met with rejection due to his small size and underdeveloped physique. Professor Abraham Erskine, a pioneer in the development of a Super-Soldier for the United States, saw potential in Rogers and whisked him into Project Rebirth, the professor’s bold experiment in enhancing the human body to its peak powers.

                Rogers found himself subjected to Erskine’s treatments— a specialized serum and exposure to a unique form of radiation—and realized the professor’s dream, becoming the world’s first, fully developed Super-Soldier. Now muscular and tall, as well as possessed of amazing strength and agility, the former ninety-eight-pound weakling watched in horror as a Nazi spy shot and killed Erskine, and thereby ensured Rogers would be the last of his kind.

                The United States government moved swiftly to fashion Rogers into a living symbol of inspiration to the public at home and soldiers abroad. And, after extensive combat training he debuted in a colorful, patriotic uniform as Captain America. Operating out of the army’s Camp Lehigh in Virginia, Rogers posed as an ordinary soldier, but conducted secret missions stateside and abroad as his alter-ego to smash spies, saboteurs, and the occasional Super Villain who threatened the country he loved so dearly. Soon, Cap captured the attention of the Red Skull, his evil counterpart in Germany, and the two formed a lasting enmity over the course of the war. The hero also gained a near-indestructible shield with which he became supremely efficient in both offense and defense.</p></td>

    <p>Steve Rogers’ forthright attitude and positive disposition has attracted a select group of people into his inner circle of friends. His longest companion is James Buchanan “Bucky” Barnes, who Rogers met in his Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood in New York and formed a close friendship with. Despite Barnes’ enlistment in the Army and Rogers’ career as Captain America during the war, the two found each other and united to form a solid battlefront against the Axis. When Barnes seemingly fell to his death, Steve Rogers felt as if a brother had been taken from him. <br><br> Though his time with Peggy Carter was comparatively short to his friendship with Bucky Barnes, Rogers’ feelings toward the capable young woman had begun to blossom into romance before his crash into the Atlantic. The two reunited in the present day, but Carter’s advanced age and her weakening health prevented them from continuing what they’d begun during the war. Regardless, Rogers maintained his connection with the woman until her death from natural causes and looks forward to what the future may bring with his relationship to Sharon Carter, Peggy’s great-niece and S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Agent 13.

        Through their partnership in the Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff have formed a friendship, something the infamous Black Widow does not offer lightly. Despite moments of Rogers’ distrust of Romanoff’s decisions and her prodding of him to fully embrace the modern world, an underlying understanding exists between the two heroes.</p><br><br><br><hr color="red">
